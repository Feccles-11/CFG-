## Purpose 
This document will outline the following:
- How I intend to use **GitHub** moving forward. 
- Define the purpose of **.gitignore** and **requirements.txt**.
- Show evidence of various Git commands and processes.

## GitHub & Me 
Github is a valuable tool for version control, enabling users to collaborate effectively and manage code efficiently. 

I will use this repository for my CFGDegree Foundation Module Assignments. 

## .gitignore 
Used to specify files and directories that should be ignored when tracking changes. This is commonly used to shield sensitive data. 

## .requirements.txt
Used to outline any dependencies, allowing collaborators to identify libraries or packages needed in order to work on the project. 

## GitHub Commands
Below is the evidence of using essential Git commands throughout this project.

### Check Status
![gitstatus.png](assets/gitstatus.png)
The command `git status` is used to assess the current status of the working directory. 

### Creating a Branch
![git branch.png](assets/git%20branch.png)
To create a new branch, use `git checkout -b` followed by the branch name in order to create and immediately switch to that branch. 
Branches play an invaluable role in collaborative version control. 

### Creating Files
![nano.png](assets/nano.png)
Files can be created using the `nano` command.

### Commit
![addcommit.png](assets/addcommit.png)
The `git add` command is used to select the changes for the following `git commit` action. 


### Push
![push.png](assets/push.png)
Changes can then be shared to the remote repository using `git push`. 

### Pull 
GitHub Pull Request:

![Mergepull.png](assets/Mergepull.png)
A pull request can then be generated on GitHub in preparation for any branch merges. 

Local Pull:

![gitpull.png](assets/gitpull.png)
An up to date version of the project can then be pulled to the local repository. 

### Merge
![merge.png](assets/merge.png)
Make sure to merge remote and local repositories where necessary. 

### Delete Branch 
When you're finished working on a branch, it's good practice to delete it. There are two ways to delete a branch. 

This can be done on GitHub:
![deleteongithub.png](assets/deleteongithub.png)

Or in the terminal:
