""" This is a possible interview coding question.
Let's check the task, implement our solution and then write tests for it:

Task Given an integer x perform the following conditional actions:
If x is odd, return 'Red'
If x is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, return 'Blue'
If x is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, return 'Red'
If x is even and greater than 20, return 'Blue'
Constraint notes: an input integer is always withing the range 1 to 100 inclusive ""
